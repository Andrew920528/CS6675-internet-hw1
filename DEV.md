Stuff I did

- had to use java 11 for compatability
- read documentation to figure out the command line interface
- I set threads per queue to 3 to run the crawler faster

Reflection:
Figuring out implementation details and the actual way people use a crawler is something I won't learn in class. Coming from a ML/ React background, I am used to working with high level technology and having a variety sources of tutorial/ documentation. Nutch is a matured web crawling library, and many aspects of it feels "old-fashioned" engineering. There is no high quality tutorial video and I often encounter cs jargon that feels unfamiliar. I re-learned the habit of reading documentation (rather than just chat-gpt) on the CLI details, and debug version conflicts and ambiguous documentation like an true computer engineer. I felt proud completing this project, and I beleive this project provides me a strong foundation in future system level engineering tasks.
